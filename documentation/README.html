<h1 id="cinderspoon">Cinderspoon</h1>
<p>A bash script for scoping Solidity code bases during the pre-assessment phase of a security audit.</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>globstar</code> is enabled by default at the beginning of the script with <code>shopt -s globstar</code>. This allows scoping any directory's <code>.sol</code> files using a single wildcard lookup. <code>cinderspoon.sh</code> can't run properly without it.</li>
<li><code>surya</code> Surya is a smart contract analysis tool. It provides many tools for breaking apart smart contracts and understanding them, including inheritance graphs, call graphs, and function breakdowns. Install globally with node package manager: <code>npm install -g surya</code>. This allows <code>cinderspoon.sh</code> to call it from the command line.</li>
<li><code>graphviz</code> (Graphviz)[https://www.graphviz.org/download/] is required by Surya for its data visualization functions. Click (here)[https://www.graphviz.org/download/] for a list of downloads by operating system. Or on apt, <code>apt install graphviz</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planned-functionality">Planned Functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatically exclude lines in files we've audited before or that don't need scoped for some other reason.</li>
<li>Apply some more cool automatic searching/sorting of .sol files to the generic output.</li>
<li>Report as an MD file instead of a plaintext outfile</li>
<li>Improve formatting of output report. Right now it just looks like a lot of numbers if you don't know what the script is doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Test repo with previously scoped contracts. (link to come)</p>
