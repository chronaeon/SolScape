# laughing-spoon
A bash script for scoping Solidity code bases during the pre-assessment phase of a security audit. 

## Planned Functionality

- Automatically exclude lines in files we've audited before or that don't need scoped for some other reason.
- Apply some more cool automatic searching/sorting of .sol files to the generic output.
- Report as an MD file instead of a plaintext outfile
